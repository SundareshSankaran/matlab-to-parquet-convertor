## Prompt

Given the prompts in /build/prompts and the mat_to_parquet.py program, provide a draft README.md file which summarises the objective of this exercise and describes the various directories contained within. Include sections for Objective, Installation, Data, License, and Contact. Where knowledge is not available, a template is fine.

Save the README file as README.md in the root folder of this repo.  Save this prompt and results in a markdown file under /Users/sinsrn/current_projects/matlab-convertor/build/prompts with a name pattern prefixed with sequence at which this prompt has been generated.

# MATLAB to Parquet Converter

## Objective

This project provides a workflow and supporting scripts to convert MATLAB `.mat` data files into Parquet format using Python. The conversion process is automated to handle multiple `.mat` files, extract relevant data and summary fields, and output them as efficient, analysis-ready Parquet files. The project is designed to facilitate data processing, analysis, and integration with modern data science tools.

## Directory Structure

- **/src**  
  Contains the main Python scripts, including `mat_to_parquet.py`, which performs the conversion from `.mat` files to Parquet files.

- **/build**  
  Contains build scripts (e.g., `build.sh`), requirements files, and a `/prompts` subdirectory for prompt/result documentation.

- **/build/prompts**  
  Stores markdown files documenting the prompts and results generated during the development process.

- **/mat_files**  
  Directory where input MATLAB `.mat` files should be placed. After successful processing, files are moved to a `done` subfolder.

- **/output_parquet**  
  Directory where the resulting Parquet files are saved. Existing Parquet files are moved to a `done` subfolder at the start of each run.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
3. Install dependencies using the provided requirements file:
   ```bash
   cd build
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or use the provided `build.sh` script for a fully automated setup.

## Data

- Place your `.mat` files in the `/mat_files` directory.
- After running the conversion script, Parquet files will be available in `/output_parquet`.
- Processed `.mat` files are moved to `/mat_files/done`.
- Previous Parquet files are archived in `/output_parquet/done`.
