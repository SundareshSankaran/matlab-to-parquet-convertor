## Prompt

Create a requirements.txt file to be used by build.sh for the following purpose: Given a number of .mat files representing Matlab data files, when the user runs a Python program to convert these files into pandas dataframes, a conversion happens which results in output pandas data frames. 

Save the result requirements.txt file in the build folder.  Save this prompt and results (annotating the prompt and results sections) as a markdown file in the /build/prompts folder.

---

## Results

**requirements.txt** (saved in `/build`):

```
scipy      # For loading .mat files (scipy.io.loadmat)
pandas     # For working with dataframes
numpy      # For numerical operations (often used with .mat data)
```
